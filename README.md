## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

The project tested my knowledge of CSS Grid and helped me to strengthen my layout skills.
It was challenging to decide which strategies to adopt to achieve the best result and to keep the code clean and maintainable.
Even if the design was simple in general, there were parts which required particular attention (the slide and the "table" of skills, for example), especially in making the site responsive.
It was great to work on this challenge.
